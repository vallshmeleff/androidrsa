Android Java RSA Encryption 
Development of a Java class for extended work with RSA encryption and SQLite database - key generation, data encryption and decoding, encryption key saving and recovery, private key protection, support for national alphabets, data and key obfuscation. We are currently in the process of adding and testing methods for encrypting large texts (20-30 times the key size). The methods are preliminarily debugged in a separate JAVA project.
